# Code-Quiz-4

## Description

In this project we were required to make a quiz with a timer. If a question was answered incorrectly time would be deducted from the clock. If the timer reached 0 it would be game-over. After the game is completed you are required to record your initials and score and store them. My motivation for this project was primarily to learn more about Javascript. Key concepts would be event.listeners,getElementbyid, producing a timer, and storing and saving scores. In this project I learned how to run my javascript dynamically through HTML in order to produce a quiz. Then by using CSS I can style my Quiz to my liking.
